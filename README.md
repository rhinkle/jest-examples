## Testing Strategies

Social Testing is a testing strategy that focuses on testing code with its dependencies. It commonly involves testing components, services, and other dependencies together. This strategy is helpful for testing code in a real-world scenario and is often used to test components and services. You can get a real idea of how your code intergrates with other code.

### Solidarity Testing

Solidarity Testing is a testing strategy that focuses on testing code with its dependencies mocked. It commonly involves mocking components, services, and other dependencies. This strategy is helpful for testing code in isolation and is often used to test components and services.
